# Opencv-python

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library that provides various tools and functions for image and video processing. The `opencv-python` module is the Python interface to OpenCV, allowing developers to use OpenCV functionalities in Python scripts.

## Installation

You can install `opencv-python` using the following pip command:

```bash

## Key Functions and Concepts in OpenCV

1. **cv2.imread():** Loads an image from a file.
2. **cv2.cvtColor():** Converts an image from one color space to another.
3. **cv2.imshow():** Displays an image in a window.
4. **cv2.imwrite():** Saves an image to a file.
5. **cv2.VideoCapture():** Captures video from a camera or a file.
6. **cv2.Canny():** Applies the Canny edge detector.
7. **cv2.findContours():** Finds contours in a binary image.
8. **cv2.drawContours():** Draws contours on an image.
9. **cv2.resize():** Resizes an image.
10. **cv2.threshold():** Applies a fixed-level threshold to an image.
